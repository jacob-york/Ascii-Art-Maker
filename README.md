A Java/JavaFX project for computer-generating Ascii Art from various sources.

This is a work in progress. It currently supports image and video rendering into ascii art, as well as:
- downloading still art as a txt file,
- saving still art as a screenshot, and/or
- downloading animated ascii art as an mp4 file,
as well as other features like Color themes.

 NOTE: JavaFX isn't compatible with MAC, so until that changes this project unfortunately won't run properly on a MAC. I ran into issues rendering videos on my Linux machine (which I'm trying to fix), so for now it might behave unpredictably on anything other than Windows.
